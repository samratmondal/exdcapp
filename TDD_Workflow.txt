TDD Workflow

1. Create mockup of the page(s) to be implemented.
    Title: EZDC | Manager Users
    <h1>: Manage Users
    Row of buttons: Add User | Edit User | Delete User
    Table:
      Checkbox | User Id | First Name | Last Name | ??

2. Identify tests to create.
    a. Title
    b. <h1>
    c. List of users
    d. Click_button "Add User" navigates to add user page
    e. Others?

3. Write and run tests. Test should fail.

4. Write code to make each test pass.
   a. Add code to handle a unique title for each page (see Sample App)
   b. Add code for navbar (Sample App)
   c. Add code to style table (Bootstrap How-To)

5. Test and fix until all test pass.
